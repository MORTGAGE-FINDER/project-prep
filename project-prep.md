- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

- Our approach to the work will involve dividing it into either group tasks or individual assignments. Each morning, we will convene as a team to review and share updates on our progress from the previous day, address any concerns or questions that may arise, and plan for future tasks. In addition, we will provide comprehensive comments in our pull requests to ensure that our work is thoroughly documented and transparent.

### Conflict Plan

In case of conflicts, the group will hold a discussion involving all members to address the issue. All members are required to participate and express their opinion, and the conversation should focus on the problem at hand and not become personal. At the end of the discussion, a vote will be held, with the majority ruling. In the event of a tie, a TA will be consulted to break it. If a team member is taking over the project, the behavior will be brought to the attention of the group, and they will discuss the reasons for it. After a discussion centered on the behavior, the team will continue with the project. The offending member will receive a warning for the first two violations, and on the third offense, the team will escalate the issue to a TA. If a team member is struggling with a task, they will be given a maximum of one hour to work on it before calling for a mandatory team meeting in Remo to address the problem. If the team cannot solve the issue in 30 minutes, a TA will be called for assistance. If a team member is not contributing to the project, the other team members will bring this behavior to the attention of the group. The team will discuss the reasons for the lack of contribution and specific tasks that have not been delivered. After a discussion centered on the behavior, the team will continue with the project, and the offending team member will receive a warning for the first two violations. On the third offense, the team will escalate the issue to a TA.

- Team members are allowed to take breaks as necessary

#### Psychological Safety

#### Work Plan

How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

- Daily Standup: Will occur at 9am - 9:15am
  - Each team member will state what items for the backlog they accomplished the previous day, and what items they will work on today
- After lunch Check-in: Will occur at 1pm - 1:15pm
  - Each team member will state what items for the backlog they accomplished so far, and what items they will work on for the rest of the day.

#### Task Tracking
- To track tasks, a Trello board will be utilized. Each day, team members will move items from the "backlog" to "in progress" under their respective names. When a task is completed, the responsible team member will remove it from the "in progress" column and move it to the "done" column.
"Meaty" Problems
- To tackle challenging problems that cannot be resolved during normal work flow, the team will divide into pairs and engage in pair programming.

#### Git Process
- All project-related documents and files, with the exception of the Task Tracker and Pitch Deck, will be stored on GitHub. 
- Links to the Task Tracker and Pitch Deck will be pinned in the team's Slack channel. All team members will be added to a new Git Organization and granted access to the project repository. In terms of Git Flow, a working branch will be created for development, and all new features will be merged into this branch. 
- Each team member will create a separate feature-specific branch for development. 
- Before merging into the working branch, the team member responsible for the feature will initiate a pull request and notify the team that a code review is required. 
- Notifications will be sent via Slack or Remo, depending on where the majority of the team is located. 
- The pull request will need to be reviewed by at least two other team members. 
- After the code review is complete, the team will merge the feature branch into the working branch. 
- Once all features are finished, the entire team will approve the merge into the main branch.
